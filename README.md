# 💡 microProjects

**Turning Boring BTech Studies into Fun Daily Code!** 🎯  
This repository is my personal journey of transforming dry academic concepts from my **BTech 3rd Year syllabus** into **micro-sized coding projects** – one project at a time, every day.

## 📚 What’s in here?

Every folder or file you see is a **self-contained micro project**, usually created in a few hours, that captures the essence of a specific topic I'm studying. The goal?  
- Learn by doing ✅  
- Study by building ✅  
- Make boring theory fun & visual ✅

## 🚀 Technologies I Use
- Python 🐍 (a lot of it!)
- GUI frameworks like `tkinter`
- Libraries like `yfinance`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, etc.
- Some occasional JavaScript/HTML/CSS (as needed)

---

## 🗓️ Project Frequency

I aim to:
- Upload **1 micro project per day**
- Keep each project **focused, functional, and fun**
- Document key logic (sometimes with visuals)

## 📌 Why I'm Doing This

- To revise and reinforce my core BTech subjects
- To stay consistent with coding practice
- To build a neat little portfolio of ideas 💻✨
